<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.center {
margin: auto;
width: 60%;
border: 3px solid #73AD21;
padding: 10px;}
</style>

<body>

13.What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?
Ans. 1. First Way is <style> Tag (Embedding Styles):
this may be useful if you have only one HTML Page and you don’t want to create a separate Stylesheet .
<html>
<head>
<style>
p{
color: green;
font-style: italic;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is just an Example</p>
</body>
</html>
2. Second way is <link> Tag (Linking an External CSS File): This is the most
common way of including an External Stylesheet. In this method you can keep all of your CSS
rules in a single file saved with an Extension .css . This will be useful if you have number of
HTML Pages. If you need to alter a style across all of your web pages you just have to edit
only this CSS file, this will affect the pages wherever you included the CSS file with the tag
below.
[code] <link href=”style.css” rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css” />
3. Third Way (Inline CSS):
Wrinting Inline CSS style is not recommended. But if you want to test quickly some
styles in your webpage you can do this.
Just include a parameter “style” in any HTML Tag.
[code]
<p style=”font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold”>This is inline style example</p>
4. Fourth Way (importing CSS inside a CSS file):
Sometimes you may need to include one more External CSS file in all of your Web Pages. This will be difficult if you have 50 or 100 HTML Pages. But you can do this easily by attaching within the present CSS file using the import rule.
[code]
@import “second.css”;
So the above @import will import all css rules into the present CSS file.
